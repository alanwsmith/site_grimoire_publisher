Last Wednesday, April 2, 2008, just before I pulled into my
neighborhood, my car turned 200,000 miles.
![200,000 miles](http://www.alanwsmith.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/20080402-snaps-0039.jpg)
Speaks well for Toyota. I replaced the timing belt at 80,000 and
160,000 miles and had a few other moderate repairs, but other than
that, all I really did was go through oil changes and tires. I knew
I wanted to see if the little car could make it 200,000, but now I
have to figure out if I want to have some work done of finally get
a new car. We'll see....
